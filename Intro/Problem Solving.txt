Overall strategy for problem solving : 
  1. Understand the problem

  2. Analyse concrete examples

  3. Divide et impera

  4. Solve the problem

  5. Simplify the answer

  6. Eventually refactor.

I. Understading the problem
  - Restate the problem in your own words;

  - Think about the inputs of the problem;

  - Think about the outputs of the problem;

  - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?

  - How to label important pieces of information.

II. Analyse concrete examples
  - Start with easy examples and analyse the output/input

  - Move on to more complex examples, do the same

  - Move on to exceptions.

III. Divide et impera
  - Divide the problem into many small problems
  
  - Start solving from the simplest problem 

  - Work my way up to the biggest problem
